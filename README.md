# nfl_fantasy_draft
Python code to help make real-time decisions during the fantasy draft.

In this model, I do not make fantasy projections but instead scrape them.

What I try to accomplish with the code is optimizing real-time draft decisions based on how the draft has unfolded, taking the projections I've gathered as ground truth.
